						<p>Mahatma Gandhi dreamt of an India which was not only free but also clean and developed.</p><br>
						
						<p>Mahatma Gandhi secured freedom for Mother India.</p><br>
						<p>Now it is our duty to serve Mother India by keeping it neat and clean.</p><br>
						<p>I take this pledge that I will remain committed towards cleanlines and devote time for this.</p><br>
						<p>I will denote 100hours per year,that is two hours per week,to voluntarily work for cleanliness.</p><br>
						<p>I will neither litter not let others litter.</p><br>
						<p>I will initiate the quest for cleanliness with myself,my family,my locaity,my village and my workplace.</p><br>
						<p>I believe that the countries of the world that appear clean are also because their citizens don't indulge in littering and also not allow to happen.</p><br>
						<p>With this firm belief,I will propate the message of Swachh Bharat Mission in villages and town.</p><br>
						<p>I will encourage 100 others to take this pledge which I am takimg today.</p><br>
						<p>I will endeavour to make them devote their 100 hours for cleanliness.</p><br>
						<p>I am confident that every step i take towards cleanliness will help in making my country clean.</p><br>
